The project studies how to maximize entanglement rates in a quantum satellite network by formulating the scheduling problem as an optimization problem and comparing multiple heuristic solutions.

**Methods Implemented**

The repository includes implementations and comparisons of:

Random heuristic

Local Greedy heuristic

Global Greedy heuristic

Convex relaxation approach (CVX)

**Tools:**

MATLAB

CVX 

Precomputed satellite and ground-station geometry data (generated using STK)

**How to Run**

Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:Najistack/ENEE_662_Project_LGA.git

Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.

Ensure CVX is installed and set up.

Run main.m 

**Notes:** The CVX solution is rounded to enforce binary feasibility and is used as a heuristic benchmark
